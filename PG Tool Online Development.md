This document details the history of the Public Goods Tool (PG Tool) and how future development may take place. For information on how to use the current version of Online PG Tools please see the "PG Tool Online v3.1 Manual"
##
**Creation of the PG Tool**
The PG Tool originated as a commissioned project from DEFRA/Natural England through the Organic Conversion Information Service (OCIS) which tasked the Organic Research Centre (ORC) with creating a method for identifying farm sustainability and public goods production. The tool created was in the form of an excel sheet and used 11 indicators, many of which are still in use in the current version:
-   Soil management
-   Biodiversity
-   Landscape and heritage
-   Water management
-   Manure management and nutrients
-   Energy and carbon
-   Food security
-   Agricultural systems diversity
-   Social capital
-   Farm business resilience
-   Animal health and welfare

**SOLID**
Following the creation of the tool, it was the utilised and modified for various other projects. in 2012/13 the tool was used in the Sustainable Organic and Low Input Dairying (SOLID) EU project, adapting the tool to capture more dairy-related data and generating assessments on farms across Europe.

**Conventional Adaptation**
As the tool was originally created for use in the OCIS, it had a particular focus on organic agriculture. In order to create a more general-use tool, DEFRA commissioned the adaptation and testing of the PG Tool on 32 conventional farms in 2014.
Report:
[Evidence Project Final Report DEFRA OF0398](https://www.organicresearchcentre.com/manage/authincludes/article_uploads/project_outputs/OF0398_PG.pdf) 

**TWECOM**
The EU project Towards Energetic Communities (TWECOM) in 2014/15 further adapted the PG Tool to explore landscape elements, focusing on wood, biomass, and hedges.
Report:

**Ekhagastiftelsen Project**
From 2013 to 2015, with support from Ekhagastiftelsen, ORC and the Research Institute of Organic Agriculture (FiBL) assessed PG Tool and other sustainability assessment tools in their coverage of the FAO Sustainability Assessment of Food and Agriculture systems (SAFA) framework.
Report:
[Further Development of Methodologies for Sustainability Assessment and Monitoring in Organic/Ecological Agriculture](https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/77086037.pdf)

**Sustainable Intensification Project**
As part of the Sustainable Intensification Project (SIP) the PG Tool was considered alongside other tools for identifying the indicators that are useful when assessing farms for sustainable intensification.
Report:
[Sustainable Intensification Platform (1) Integrated Farm Management - LM0201](https://randd.defra.gov.uk/ProjectDetails?ProjectID=18802&FromSearch=Y&Publisher=1&SearchText=sustainable%20intensification&SortString=ProjectCode&SortOrder=Asc&Paging=10#Description)

**TempAg**
In 2016 the Flanders Research Institute for Agriculture (ILVO) conducted a literature review on sustainability assessment tools which included PG Tool.

**iSAGE**
The iSAGE EU-funded project started in 2016 and aimed to explore the Innovations for Sustainable Sheep and Goat Production in Europe. An adapted version was once again created and shared with all members for to generate sustainability assessments on various sheep and goat farms across the EU.
Report:
[Sustainability Assessment of Goat and Sheep Farms: A Comparison between European Countries](https://doi.org/10.3390/su12083099)

**SustainFARM**
Similar to the TWECOM project, this research from 2016 to 2019 explored the use of woody products in grazing systems. PG Tools was used to provide an overall assessment of different farm and wood use types.
Report:
[A Multi-factorial Sustainability Assessment of Five European Agroforestry Farms](https://www.repository.utl.pt/bitstream/10400.5/18737/1/EURAFIVConf_Smith_LG_et_all_page_265_268.pdf)

**SEEGSLIP**
Finishing in 2021, the SEEGSLIP project sought to understand the innovations in sustainable economic and ecological grazing systems. To do this members utilised the PG Tool with adaptations for compatibility with Farmbench and Agrecalc.
Report:

**2020 ELMS Test & Trials**
Continuing the role of DEFRA in creation and support of the PG Tools, the Environment and Land Management Scheme Test & Trials adapted and evaluated the usability of PG Tools in the future of developing and assessing ELMs.

**FAB Farmers**
At the request of the Soil Association, the FAB Farmers EU project used PG Tools to explore the functional biodiversity of farms in 12 pilot regions across 5 counties from 2018 to 2022.
Report:
[Report on baseline measurement of FAB performance of farms](https://www.nweurope.eu/media/18750/2022_baseline_report_pgtool_fin.pdf)

**FOODLEVERS**
Now in its final year, the FOODLEVERS project started in 2020 and aimed to identify the leverage points for organic and sustainable food systems, allowing them to be promoted and grow. To do this they modified PG Tool to capture additional data for ecosystem services and socio-economics.
Report:
[Deliverable 1.3: Data collection protocols](https://www.foodlevers.org/fileadmin/user_upload/D1.3_Final.pdf)

**Nature Scot**
Specifically focused on Scotland, this 2021 project used PG Tools to assess the public goods provided by different agriculture types across Scotland and explored the effects of alternative payment policies.
Report:
[Preparing the Evidence Base for Post-Brexit agriculture in Scotland â€“ case studies on alternative payments](https://www.nature.scot/sites/default/files/2021-02/Publication%202021%20-%20NatureScot%20Research%20Report%201201%20-%20Preparing%20for%20Post-Brexit%20agriculture%20in%20Scotland%20-%20case%20studies%20on%20alternative%20payments.pdf)

**Organic ELMS Test & Trials**
Currently ongoing, this project builds upon the previous 2020 Environment and Land Management Test & Trial by assessing the public goods produced by organic farms specifically and how future policies may implement or impact this.

**Re-Livestock**
Starting in 2022, the Re-Livestock project has been the source of the online adaptation of PG Tools. Spear-headed by [MVARC](https://mvarc.eu/) the online version will also be adapted for specific use in relation to Re-Livestock, while handing the general v3.1 to ORC for future use.

**Global Farm Metric**
While initially starting in 2017, the Global Farm Metric (GFM) has built upon the PGTools, adding in additional indicators, weighting for results, and other adaptations to create a general farm sustainability tool for global use. The work of the GFM still continues today.
Reports:
[Global Farm Metric Reports](https://www.globalfarmmetric.org/reports/)

**Other uses**
The PG Tool has also been used for individual consultations with farms, estates, and botanic gardens. It has also been used in multiple PhD projects around the world.
##
**Future Development and Use**
The PG Tool is highly adaptable and had been used in a multitude of scenarios to assess a wide range of indicators. The move to an online-version will allow for an altogether more comprehensible experience for farmers and researchers alike.
The move to github also allows for researchers to easily fork and adapt PG Tool for their own use. The base version of the PG Tool will be kept by ORC to provide a single source for anyone who wishes to complete an assessment themselves.
To encourage adaptation the PG Tool has been released under an open MIT licence. We would urge those who wish to adapt PG Tool for their own research to contact [github@organicresearchcentre.com](mailto:github@organicresearchcentre.com) with details of their adaptation so we can keep the records up to date. Likewise, we would encourage any published work utilising the base version of the PG Tool to reference it as so:
